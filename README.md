Website to check out your personal stats for Dead By Daylight (https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/)

The stats will be pulled via the Steam API, unfortunately BHVR (Creator of Dead By Daylight) don't have a publicly accessible API for other platforms such as Playstation, Xbox, Epic Games, Windows Store, Switch.

The only platform you can get game stats for Dead By Daylight are Steam (PC)

The only way for your profile stats to become available on the site would be if you signed in and viewed your stats or if somebody else looks up your stats
